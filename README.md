# Railfence
The simplest such cipher is the rail fence technique, in which the plaintext is written down as a sequence of diagonals and then read off 
as a sequence of rows. For example, to encipher the message “meet me after the toga party” with a rail fence of depth 2, we write the 
following:
                 m  e  m  a  t  r  h  t  g  p  r  y
                  e  t  e  f  e  t  e  o  a  a  t
The encrypted message is
